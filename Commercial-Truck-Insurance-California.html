  <meta name="description" content="Commercial truck insurance protects you from out-of-pocket expenses if any of your vehicles are involved in an accident while using your truck to transport items. If you also use your truck professionally and personally, a truck insurance policy will fill in any gaps with your personal auto insurance.

When it comes to insurance in California, trucking policies typically begin with primary liability and build on that with other commercial insurance coverages based on your business's unique needs. You are required by law to have primary liability coverage.">
